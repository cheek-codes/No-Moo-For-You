### This is a recipe site that was created for a friend with a milk allergy where she can easily access recipes that does not include any dairy products. This will constantly be updated with new recipes.

## What I used
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT


## Optimizations
I plan on adding new recipes, add in dark mode, and when the recipes become too much to handle, I plan on making it easier to navigate.


## Lesson Learned:
I learned to use AI to create recipes.
